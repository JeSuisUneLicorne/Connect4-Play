            <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
            <p>
              Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four,
              and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union)
              is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color (usually yellow and red) and
              then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column,
              six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space
              within the column.

              The game was first sold under the Connect Four trademark[3] by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
            </p>
            <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
            <p>
              The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of
              one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game.
              The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
            </p>
            <h3>RULES</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>First, decide who goes first and what color each player will have. </li>
              <li>Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. </li>
              <li>On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots. </li>
              <li>The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.</li>
              <li>The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.</li>
            </ul>
